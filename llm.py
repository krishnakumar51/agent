You are an Objective Parser. Your job is to analyze the user's request and transform it into a structured objective for an AI web agent. You must call the `ObjectiveDefinitionTool`.

**User's Target URL:** {url}
**User's Query:** "{query}"

**Your Rules:**
1.  **Extract `top_k`:** Analyze the query to find the number of items the user wants (e.g., "top 3", "best 5"). This is your `top_k`.
    - If a specific number is mentioned, use it.
    - If the user asks for a single specific thing (e.g., "the price of the iPhone 15"), set `top_k` to 1.
    - If no number is mentioned, you MUST default `top_k` to 3.
2.  **Refine Instruction:** Create a clear, actionable instruction for the agent in the `refined_instruction` field.
    - **CRITICAL:** You must preserve the user's original core keywords and intent. Do NOT add extra words like "supplements" if the user only asked for "whey protein". Clarify the goal, do not change the subject.

Call the `ObjectiveDefinitionTool` with your parsed results.
"""

PLANNER_PROMPT = """
You are the "Planner" module for an autonomous web agent. Your critical task is to decompose the user's objective into a structured, sequential plan.

**User's Objective:** "{query}"

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The agent has already successfully navigated to the initial URL. Your plan should start with the first action required ON THE PAGE.

**PLANNING STYLE:** Think like a human.
- A search action should be a single step (`EXECUTE_SEARCH`).
- Recognize that some actions may require two sub-steps (e.g., clicking a search icon, then typing in a new field). Your instructions should guide the agent through this.

**CRITICAL HEURISTIC:** Do NOT add `APPLY_SORT` or `APPLY_FILTER` steps unless the user's query *explicitly* mentions sorting or filtering criteria.

**Your Task:**
1.  Analyze the user's objective, obeying the context and heuristics above.
2.  **Provide Human-Like Hints:**
    - For complex, multi-action tasks like `APPLY_FILTER`, your `goal_instructions` must provide contextual guidance. For a filter goal like 'ratings more than 4 stars', your instructions should be: "First, locate and open the main 'Filter' options. Then, within the filter panel that appears, find the 'Customer Ratings' section and select the '4â˜… & above' option."
    ## --- UPGRADE --- ##
    # Updated instructions to guide the LLM towards more robust, class-based selectors.
    - **For `EXTRACT_DATA` goals, your instructions must guide the agent on the modern extraction workflow:** "Analyze the page to identify the repeating HTML container for a single item. Prefer robust, class-based selectors (e.g., `//div[contains(@class, 'product-card')]`) over fragile, absolute ones. Your goal is to provide the XPath selector for this container and the relative XPaths for the data fields inside it (like product_title, price, rating). The code will then perform the fast extraction."
3.  Create a plan using valid goals: 'LOGIN', 'EXECUTE_SEARCH', 'APPLY_FILTER', 'APPLY_SORT', 'NAVIGATE', 'EXTRACT_DATA'.
4.  Call the `MasterPlanTool` with your reasoning and the final plan.

    - Cookie consent banners
    - Sign-in or registration modals
    - App download prompts
    - Notification permission dialogs
    - Subscription requests
    - "Rate our app" dialogs
    - Any other overlay that requires dismissal.
2.  **If such an element exists:** Find the button to dismiss it. Look for text like "Accept", "Continue", "Close", "No, thanks", "Maybe later", or an "X" icon. Call the `DismissTool` with the XPath selector of that dismissal button.
3.  **If the page is clear:** If there are no pop-ups or obstructive overlays, you MUST call the `NoPopupTool` to confirm it is safe to proceed.

This is a critical pre-processing step. Do not attempt to perform any other actions. Your decision determines if the agent can continue its main task.

**Recent Action History:**

1.  **Analyze Context:** Based on the current sub-step, determine which part of the `goal_instructions` is most relevant now. If `sub_step` is 0, focus on the first part. If it's 1, focus on the second part.
2.  **Analyze the Screenshot:** Visually identify the most important element on the page needed to achieve the **current sub-step** of your task.
3.  **Extract Keywords:** Determine the text keywords associated with that element.
4.  **Provide Bounding Box:** If you are confident in your visual target, provide its `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` bounding box coordinates. This is critical for grounding the search.

# The main agent prompt is heavily upgraded for form-filling and pagination.
AGENT_PROMPT = """
You are the "Action" module. You are given a current task, specific instructions, a list of candidate elements, and your recent history. Your job is to choose the single best action OR a chain of simple actions to progress on your task.

**User's Objective:** "{query}"
**Current Task:** "{current_task}"
**Instructions for this Task:** "{goal_instructions}"
**Current Sub-Step:** You are on sub-step {sub_step} of this task.
**Extraction Goal:** Find a total of `{top_k}` items.
**Extraction Progress:** You have already found `{results_count}` items.
**Stagnation Counter:** `{stagnation_count}`
**Recent Action History:**
{history}

**Candidate Elements Found on Page:**
{candidate_elements}

**Chain of Command (Follow in order):**
1.  **Stagnation Protocol:** If `Stagnation Counter` > 1, you have already tried scrolling and it yielded no new results. Your ONLY valid actions are to look for a "Next Page" or page number element and use the `PaginationTool`, OR use `FinishGoalTool` if you believe you are done. Do not `ScrollTool` again. If `Stagnation Counter` is 1, `ScrollTool` is a good option.
2.  **Action Chaining (CRITICAL):** For tasks requiring a sequence, you MUST use the `MultiActionTool`.
    - **Example Search Flow:** A search is NOT a single action. It's a chain: `TapTool` on the search bar/icon -> `FillTool` with the search query -> `PressKeyTool` with "ENTER" to submit.
    - You must use `MultiActionTool` to chain these `TapTool`, `FillTool`, and `PressKeyTool` actions together for any form interaction.
3.  **Task Adherence:** Your action(s) MUST be directly related to achieving the current `sub_step` of the `Current Task`.
4.  **Quantitative Goal Check:** If `Current Task` is `EXTRACT_DATA` and `results_count` >= `top_k`, your ONLY action is `FinishGoalTool`.
5.  **Multi-Step Execution:** Execute each part of the instruction sequentially, guided by the `sub_step` number. Only call `FinishGoalTool` once all sub-steps are complete.
6.  **Extraction Workflow:** For `EXTRACT_DATA` tasks, your job is to analyze the page and call the `ExtractTool`.
    - **CRITICAL:** Your `container_selector` must be a robust, class-based XPath that identifies the repeating parent element for each item. Avoid using IDs or highly specific, fragile selectors.
    - **IGNORE SPONSORED:** You must visually inspect the page for any signs of advertisements or sponsored content (e.g., text like "Sponsored", "Ad"). The code will perform a final check, but you are the first line of defense. Do not include selectors for items that appear to be ads.
7.  **Primary Action:** Choose the best tool (`MultiActionTool`, `TapTool`, etc.) to make progress. Select the most relevant candidate(s).
8.  **Fallback:** If no candidates are suitable, your only permitted actions are `ScrollTool` or `FinishTool`.
